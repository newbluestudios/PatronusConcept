This is a boilerplate configuration for NextJs, Twillio, and Firebase

I've chosen to use NextJS because it comes with static generation and server side rendering out of the box.  It also makes it easy to do client-side rendering in case some parts of the page can be made static while dynamically fetching on an as-need basis.

It also saves a significant amount of time to finish a project since things like Routing and Containerization don't need to be setup, and dynamic routing is also included.
