The importance of a can-do attitude, and some of the more interesting annecdotes along the way.

First of all, our beliefs shape our reality.  Beliefs change our bodies and minds, and the belief that you **can** hear complex harmonies, intricate melodic lines, and groovy rhythm patterns is true.  In some way, the belief creates the possibility.  A skeptic might say that the belief only removes the hindrance to learning, but I would say that something else is gained.  

When a person gives up the will to live, they can die - a phenomenon known as pschogenic death.  At one point in time, it was believed that no human being could live for more than a week without food, simply because no recorded person had done it.  


Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
